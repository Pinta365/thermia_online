# THERMIA_ONLINE

This project is still in development and very much a work in progress. Use at your own risk.

Thermia Online is a Deno project used to access the API behind
[http://online-genesis.thermia.se](https://online-genesis.thermia.se/).

It is also available for Node.js through this [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oura_api).

Currently only tried using the API with my own heat pump/login for the
[http://online-genesis.thermia.se](https://online-genesis.thermia.se/) site but working on supporting the
[http://online.thermia.se](https://online.thermia.se/) login as well.

## Supported/tested heat pumps
